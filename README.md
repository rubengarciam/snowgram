**Features**

* Two different layouts: grid or full width-single column
* Full width image on posts (recommended mininum width of 960px)
* Fully responsive. Mobile, multi device ready
* Fast, very fast (as much as scriptogr.am can provide)
* Clean, lovely typo
* No widgets, let's you focus on writing (or telling stories or whatever you like) 

**Upcoming features**

* Variables (linked to next *scriptogr.am* release)
* Dynamic social links (pending variables)
* LESS CSS
* Full HTML5 validation
* Black CSS version

At the moment the change of layouts, social links, etc needs to be performed in the code as _scriptogr.am_ doesn't provide _CSS_ variables support yet.
